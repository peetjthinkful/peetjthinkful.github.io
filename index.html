<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><em>This brief article is designed to be an illustration of how you could utilise objects in your code. It is not meant to be definitive, neither does it claim to be the optimum way of defining/creating objects. It does however aim to be an &lsquo;easy-ish&rsquo; way of getting into objects and how you might use them in a real world scenario.</em></p>

<p><strong>During a mentor session with one of my students, we started talking about how she might approach the Shopping List project. The obvious and simplest approach was (from an implementation point of view) to hold a bunch of String objects inside an array. However, on reflection we felt that this could perhaps be too simplistic. For example, let&rsquo;s say that one of the projects&#8217; requirements was to be able to cross out items on the list instead of deleting the item. It would be pretty hard to implement this if all we had was an Array of String objects.</strong></p>

<p><em>Enter the Object</em>. As we discussed the problem, we realised that if we could perhaps have a slightly more complex representation of the item in the list, (after all, each item is a real thing, has certain properties and is certainly more than a just a string of letters!) then perhaps we could give the item a certain state which would mean that it is deleted but not removed from the list &ndash; ie. crossed out.</p>

<p>It seemed to me to be the perfect place to start introducing objects in our mentor sessions. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how we might model a shopping list in Javascript.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that we have 3 items in our shopping list: Bread, Apples and Whiskey. It would be very simple to implement this as a Javascript Array like so:</p>

<h3>Example 1 &ndash; A Shopping List as an Array of Strings</h3>

<pre><code>// Create the array using the array literal syntax
var myShoppingList = [];

// Add items to the array
myShoppingList.push("Bread");
myShoppingList.push("Apples");
myShoppingList.push("Whiskey");

// Print them to the console
console.log(myShoppingList[0]);
console.log(myShoppingList[1]);
console.log(myShoppingList[2]);
</code></pre>

<p>Done! Its simple but you could argue that it is too &lsquo;simplistic&rsquo;, As an illustration, let&rsquo;s say you wanted to remove an item from the list. Well you could just delete it from the array. The problem is how do you get it back again? Another example of the simplicity of this implementation is that say you wanted to merely cross out items as you added them to your physical shopping basket &ndash; ideally you would want to retain the item in the list but have it notionally deleted &ndash; it would be pretty tricky to implement this behaviour with an Array of Strings. Of course it could be done &ndash; and in numerous ways, however I believe that these &lsquo;solutions&rsquo; would not be as intuitive and robust as a solution that employed an Array of Objects rather than Strings.</p>

<h3>Example 2 &ndash; Introducing the Object way</h3>

<pre><code>// Create the array using the array literal syntax
var myShoppingList = [];

// Create the object literals
var bread = { itemName: "Bread", itemPrice: 3.60, isDeleted: false };
var apples = { itemName: "Apples", itemPrice: 1.60, isDeleted: false };
var whiskey = { itemName: "Whiskey", itemPrice: 100.95, isDeleted: false };

// Add the Objects to the shopping list array
myShoppingList.push(bread);
myShoppingList.push(apples);
myShoppingList.push(whiskey);
</code></pre>

<p>The example above adds 3 objects to the <code>myShoppingList</code> Array. Note that the objects themselves are <em>object literals</em> created with the <code>{}</code> or curly brace syntax. Let&rsquo;s take one of the objects and break it down, before explaining why we gave it the attributes we did. So &ndash; I want a bottle of Whiskey for Christmas, so I added it to my shopping list:</p>

<pre><code>{ 
    itemName: "Whiskey", 
    itemPrice: 100.95, 
    isDeleted: false
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let us (sort of) digress for a moment. It&rsquo;s pretty clear that I have given my bottle of whiskey 3 properties: a name, a price and an <code>isDeleted</code> property. The name and the price are pretty obvious but the <code>isDeleted</code> property means that I can still have the bottle of whiskey in the list but have it notionally crossed off the list. You could access the whiskey from the Array as follows:</p>

<p>var myWhiskeyBottle = myShoppingList[0];</p>

<p>You could further access any of the properties of the Whiskey thus:</p>

<pre><code>var nameOfWhiskey = myWhiskeyBottle.name;
var priceOfWhiskey = myWhiskeyBottle.price;
var stateOfWhiskey = myWhiskeyBottle.isDeleted;

console.log(nameOfWhiskey);
console.log(priceOfWhiskey);
console.log(stateOfWhiskey);
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that I gave the whiskey an <code>isDeleted</code> value of <code>false</code>. So the scenario is as follows:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the Bottle shop and I put my favourite bottle in my trolley. I cross it off my list. Effectively it has been deleted from the list but my requirements dictate that I should still see it on the list with a line through it. So I simply set the <code>isDeleted</code> property to <code>true</code>.</p>

<pre><code>myWhiskeyBottle.isDeleted = true;
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s inspect which items have been deleted in the Array:</p>

<pre><code>console.log("Bread: " + myShoppingList[0].isDeleted);
console.log("Apples: " + myShoppingList[1].isDeleted);
console.log("Whiskey: " + myShoppingList[2].isDeleted);
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly the whiskey has been deleted from the list so now my Shopping list should look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bread,</li>
<li>Apples,</li>
<li><del>Whiskey</del></li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>isDeleted</code> property has given us the ability to provide a richer interface. This is just with a few object literals with a few simple properties. It is worth noting at this point that if we were building a production system we would find another more robust &amp; reusable way to create the objects themselves &ndash; however the point is here to get a sense of their usefulness in this and other non-trivial situations.</p>

<p>Hopefully I have shown the value of starting to use objects in your code where you are trying to model even the simplest of things. Don&rsquo;t worry about starting with a simple object literal. You can get more complex as you begin to understand more about Javascript and system design.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or questions regarding the above please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p>One final thing &ndash; I believe the more you read about a topic (utilising different perspectives and analogies) the more likely you are to understand it well. Therefore I encourage you to find other articles that talk about object creation and read them. I have listed a few below that I believe you may find helpful. Note that this comes with a warning &ndash; some of them are pretty complex so you will have to be prepared for a lot of study if you are anything like me!</p>
