<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>_The truth about CSS Positioning is that it&rsquo;s a pain in the ****. No matter how many times I read up on the topic, it still eludes me from time to time. I think it&rsquo;s because pages can get pretty complex and each one is different. Well, this article is an attempt to tackle the issue head on with as little fluff as possible. We won&rsquo;t be covering all of the details but we will be providing some basic definitions and examples. Hopefully this can provide beginners with a helpful reference from which the topic can be investigated and hopefully mastered.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><em>This brief article is designed to be an illustration of how you could utilise objects in your code. It is not meant to be definitive, neither does it claim to be the optimum way of defining/creating objects. It does however aim to be an &lsquo;easy-ish&rsquo; way of getting into objects and how you might use them in a real world scenario.</em></p>

<p><strong>During a mentor session with one of my students, we started talking about how she might approach the Shopping List project. The obvious and simplest approach was (from an implementation point of view) to hold a bunch of String objects inside an array. However, on reflection we felt that this could perhaps be too simplistic. For example, let&rsquo;s say that one of the projects&#8217; requirements was to be able to cross out items on the list instead of deleting the item. It would be pretty hard to implement this if all we had was an Array of String objects.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><em>This is an experiment with Octopress. I&rsquo;ve been using Wordpress for ages. Recently I&rsquo;ve been hankering for a platform that is a lot simpler to use. That may seem a bit strange seeing as it is all commandline, github, Ruby&hellip;etc, but actually I&rsquo;m talking about the writing of the posts as well as the generation of the site. I can write the posts in markdown, run a few commands and I have a site. I don&rsquo;t have to wait for slow http connections and faff around with HTML source code (not that its&#8217; hard &ndash; it is just messy when it shouldn&rsquo;t have to be). If you want to know how to setup and use Octopress &ndash; then read on&hellip;</em></p>

<h3>Setting up Octopress</h3>

<p>This was pretty easy actually. After struggling with Jekyll for a number of days (ultimately, my goal was to host the blog on GitHub and Jekyll just wasn&rsquo;t clear enough) I just happened to come across Octopress. It looked like a good option ie. no database, posts created in markdown or html, a statically generated (quick) site&hellip; so I decided to try it out. Well, I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.</p>

<p>There is no point me repeating the setup process here &ndash; I will just point you to the relevant link: <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/" title="Octopress Setup">Setting up Octopress</a>. It&rsquo;s very good. Once you have installed Octopress and generated a site you have to deploy it. There are a few options here &ndash; my preferred one was to deploy to GitHub Pages.</p>

<h3>Publishing your first post</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are up and running and want to publish your first post. The process is beginning to smooth out nicely for me and goes something like this:</p>

<h4>Assumptions</h4>

<ol>
<li>You have a nice markdown editor and know how to use it (Try <a href="http://mouapp.com/" title="Mou">Mou</a> for the Mac).</li>
<li>You have a <a href="http://github.com" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> account.</li>
<li>You know your way around the terminal.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Deploying to GitHub Pages</h4>

<p>If you get to this stage, you will have installed Octopress as well as the Octopress theme using the command:</p>

<pre><code>rake install
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to suggest that you follow the instructions on <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">Deploying to GitHub Pages</a>. This involves creating a repository on GitHub and then running a setup command:</p>

<pre><code>rake setup_github_pages
</code></pre>

<p>NB. All of these commands are executed on the terminal from your Octopress directory. Mine is installed at:</p>

<pre><code>/Users/peetj/GitHub/octopress
</code></pre>

<p>Now you are ready to actually publish a post. The great thing about Octopress is that you can publish your posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format. After years of using Wordpress and those ever so slightly dodgy HTML editors, I felt like this would be a breath of fresh air. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;ve always loved WordPress especially the user interface and all the great plugins you could make use of. But let&rsquo;s face it, there is a lot of overhead going on there and pretty much like any CMS, it is a pain in the butt for non-techy users &ndash; no matter what the advocates say. Anyway I was right &ndash; now I use a lightweight editor &ndash; Mou (see above) which itself has a live preview mode. I get none of the fluff that is part of Microsoft Word and I get an overall pleasantly enjoyable writing experience.</p>

<p>Posts are generally formatted like this:</p>

<pre><code>yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-post.markdown
</code></pre>

<p>They are placed in the directory:</p>

<pre><code>../octopress/source/_posts
</code></pre>

<p>You can also generate a new post which is probably a better idea because the post will contain some skeleton content. You can read about Octopress <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">blogging basics</a> here. Anyway, to generate a post do this:</p>

<pre><code>rake new_post[my-new-post]
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new (markdown) post in the ../octopress/source/_posts directory called 2014-02-28-my-new-post.markdown (assuming that today is 28 Feb 2014).</p>

<p>So just to recap, we have installed Octopress, we have setup GitHub pages so that we can publish our posts at GitHub and we have created a new post. Now, open up the post in your favourite text editor. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>---
layout: post
title: "my-new-post"
date: 2014-02-28 5:59
comments: true
external-url:
categories:
---
</code></pre>

<p>You can read the details in the &lsquo;Blogging Basics&rsquo; link above about what options you have here but basically Octopress has generated some meta-data for you where you can tell it what to do ie. turn comments on or off, specify the layout, publish as draft (you would add another line that says &lsquo;published: false&rsquo;) and so on. Now that we have a post, we need to commit it to GitHub and publish it.</p>

<h4>Commit to GitHub</h4>

<p>Since we have created some new content, we need to publish it to Github. All we need to do is run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "Just created a cool new post"
git push origin source
</code></pre>

<p>The first commands adds any modified/new files to the staging area of your local repository. The second commands commits the files to the local repository. The third command syncs with GitHub. Now that you have all your changes on GitHub you can publish your post.</p>

<h4>Publish your Post</h4>

<p>Run the commands:</p>

<pre><code>rake generate
rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>This generates the new site and publishes the post. The output that follows the command will go something like this:</p>

<pre><code>## Generating Site with Jekyll

<p>So there you have it! How to make a start with Octopress. There are also many others using Octopress and quite a few of them have written about the transition. These are definitely worth a read if you want to start using Octopress &ndash; so I have listed a few that I have looked at myself below. Happy Blogging!</p>
