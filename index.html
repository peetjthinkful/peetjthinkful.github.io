  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was once asked in an interview by a very smart architect to describe the most important aspects of a good architecture. I replied that it should be simple and decoupled. Fortunately he agreed with me although I didn&rsquo;t end up working for the company!</p>

<p>I believe that if you have these 2 things going for you then you are off to a great start. Often, other facets of a good architecture follow from these two principles. For example &lsquo;extensibility&rsquo; &ndash; the ease of adding new and extra functionality to your existing system. A decoupled system will certainly enable you to add new parts with minimal fuss.</p>

<p>The key here is dependency. In a decoupled system, each &lsquo;component&rsquo; works without needing the other components in the system ie. a given component is not dependent on any other. If it were, then we wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to load and initialise it without loading some other component first.</p>

<p>So, how does such a system work. Well one way of making this work is by implementing some kind of message layer. Components talk to each other by passing and receiving  messages. Let&rsquo;s look at an example to round things off.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that our system is made up of a mapping component (MP1) and a graphing component (G1). The job of MP1 is to display a map of Australia revealing the 50 hottest places last summer. These show up as &lsquo;hot spots&rsquo; on the map when it is rendered. MP1 then &lsquo;publishes&rsquo; a message to the message layer. The message itself contains an identifier and a payload. The identifier is just a name &ndash; let&rsquo;s call it &lsquo;HOTSPOT_DATA_MSG&rsquo;. The payload contains some structured data obviously related to the top 50 hotspots.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, G1 has informed the message layer that it would like to know about any message with the name HOTSPOT_DATA_MSG &ndash; in other words it &lsquo;subscribes&rsquo; to a message with a particular name. Whenever such a message is sent, G1 receives it and displays a nice graph of the temperatures of the 50 hottest places in Australia.</p>

<p>You will notice that there is a single dependency in this kind of a system. every component is dependent on the messaging layer component which itself exists just to send and receive messages between components like a kind of telephone exchange operator. This enables components to both co-exist without depending on each other. The only dependencies are the core aspects of the system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most important factors to keep in mind when developing any non-trivial application is maintenence. If an issue arises or additional functionality needs to be built then a simplified design &amp; architecture will go a long way to help you either fix the issue or build the new functionality.</p>

<p>Simplification of the architecture means less connection points between different areas of the application which in turns means less potential for bugs.</p>

<p>Any project with more than a single developer will invariably mean that one day you will have to hand over your code (probably many thousands of lines of Javascript or something similar!) to your team mate while you go off skiing for a week. Well let&rsquo;s hope your design is as simple as you can make it because otherwise he or she will give you the cold shoulder when you get back!!</p>

<p>Seriously though, simplicity means a reusable and extensible system. Not to mention that such things are more fun to work on than over-engineered monstrosities. I personally have worked with components that were so complex in their design that I was at a total loss when any adjustments had to be made. I have subsequently worked with components that have the same functionality but were incredibly simple to use and work with. Sometimes developers are too clever for their own good!</p>

<p>Next time you have to design and code something, think of your team mates as well as your users&hellip;and keep it simple!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You would&rsquo;ve thought that I had learnt my lesson when it comes to backing up my files. I think I  must have helped dozens of friends over the years who had lost a critical file and hadn&rsquo;t made a backup. Well I managed to do exactly the same thing at work the other day.</p>

<p>I was working in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> on Windows and managed to lose a mornings work &ndash; Doh! I quickly realised that I had no local history and hadn&rsquo;t committed to any repository for a while. Hmmmm&hellip; what to do! Well nothing actually, I just had to write all the code again !!!</p>

<p>I did, however find a nice local history plugin for Sublime Text which is really the point of this post. No more troubles!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vishr/local-history">Local History</a> is a Sublime Text (2 &amp; 3) plugin for maintaining local history of files. [backup | open | compare | incremental diff].</p>

<p>It helps if you have the <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/">package installer</a> for ST. In this case just type &lsquo;Local History&rsquo; at the install package prompt and there you go.</p>

<p>Once installed, I just configured the user settings to have a <code>history_retention</code> of 90 days:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "history_retention": 90, // in days
}
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to work really well!</p>

<p>Another backup solution that I have signed up for is <a href="https://www.zipcloud.com/planprice-information">ZipCloud</a>. I&rsquo;ve included a link to the pricing page as it is difficult to find. You only get a few Gig if you get the free plan so I upgraded to the Premium Plan and am paying about 7 USD per month.</p>

<p>The reason I needed it is that I am upgrading my Mac to Yosemite and don&rsquo;t really have an adequate backup solution. After running the backup client for about 2 weeks (yes really!), I finally backed up everything. It was quite impressive as I just had to pause it everytime I needed to &ndash; other than that I ran it constantly.</p>

<p>It is finally done and I can now upgrade. Yay!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Rethinking the design of the &lsquo;unlock&rsquo; screen</h3>

<p>If you possess an iPhone, then you will be somewhat familiar with the &lsquo;unlock&rsquo; screen. It would look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unlockscreen.png" title="Title" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><strong>My iPhone unlock screen</strong></p>

<p>The problem I have is that I have quite small hands and being right handed I generally carry my phone in my left hand and use it with my right. &lsquo;So what?&rsquo; you might say! Well when I want to take a picture quickly I try to use my left hand to activate the camera from the camera icon. I usually find the swipe action next to impossible. Firstly my thumb doesn&rsquo;t really reach the icon without a stretch and secondly, because I have to stretch I find that I don&rsquo;t have much mobility in my thumb as a consequence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/unlockscreen2.jpg" title="Title" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><strong>Me desperately trying to &lsquo;push&rsquo; the unlock screen up so I can get to the camera</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that the design is a bit different when the new (larger/wider) iPhone 6 comes out. Maybe the icon could be moved to the center somewhere or we there could be a little indicator arrow pointing up positioned bottom middle. This could reveal one or two functions on a single tap &ndash; one of which is the camera. It would be much easier to select it &ndash; with either hand!</p>

<p>Hopefully all those right handed people with small hands will have something to celebrate come September 9. It&rsquo;s not a massive thing &ndash; but I believe it would be a UX improvement.</p>

    <h1>Speed Cameras in and around NSW</h1>

    <p style="width:600px;font-size:1.3em;">
    One of my students at <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> wanted to knock up a site utilising the Google Store API. We decided that the easiest way was to use a great jQuery plugin by Bjorn Holine called (not surprisingly) the <a href="http://www.bjornblog.com/web/jquery-store-locator-plugin">jquery-store-locator-plugin</a>.

    So I came up with a speed camera locator for NSW. I had to do a bit of tweaking to the plugin code plus some resource injection for this Octopress post. It took a fair few hours but hopefully the result was worth it. The source data was obtained from the <a href="http://data.gov.au">Australian Government</a>.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>_The truth about CSS Positioning is that it&rsquo;s a pain in the ****. No matter how many times I read up on the topic, it still eludes me from time to time. I think it&rsquo;s because pages can get pretty complex and each one is different. Well, this article is an attempt to tackle the issue head on with as little fluff as possible. We won&rsquo;t be covering all of the details but we will be providing some basic definitions and examples. Hopefully this can provide beginners with a helpful reference from which the topic can be investigated and hopefully mastered.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><em>This brief article is designed to be an illustration of how you could utilise objects in your code. It is not meant to be definitive, neither does it claim to be the optimum way of defining/creating objects. It does however aim to be an &lsquo;easy-ish&rsquo; way of getting into objects and how you might use them in a real world scenario.</em></p>

<p><strong>During a mentor session with one of my students, we started talking about how she might approach the Shopping List project. The obvious and simplest approach was (from an implementation point of view) to hold a bunch of String objects inside an array. However, on reflection we felt that this could perhaps be too simplistic. For example, let&rsquo;s say that one of the projects&#8217; requirements was to be able to cross out items on the list instead of deleting the item. It would be pretty hard to implement this if all we had was an Array of String objects.</strong></p>

<p><em>This is an experiment with Octopress. I&rsquo;ve been using Wordpress for ages. Recently I&rsquo;ve been hankering for a platform that is a lot simpler to use. That may seem a bit strange seeing as it is all commandline, github, Ruby&hellip;etc, but actually I&rsquo;m talking about the writing of the posts as well as the generation of the site. I can write the posts in markdown, run a few commands and I have a site. I don&rsquo;t have to wait for slow http connections and faff around with HTML source code (not that its&#8217; hard &ndash; it is just messy when it shouldn&rsquo;t have to be).
