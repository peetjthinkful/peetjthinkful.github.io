<p>If you possess an iPhone, then you will be somewhat familiar with the &lsquo;unlock&rsquo; screen. It would look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unlockscreen.png" title="Title" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><strong>My iPhone unlock screen</strong></p>

<p>The problem I have is that I have quite small hands and being right handed I generally carry my phone in my left hand and use it with my right. &lsquo;So what?&rsquo; you might say! Well when I want to take a picture quickly I try to use my left hand to activate the camera from the camera icon. I usually find the swipe action next to impossible. Firstly my thumb doesn&rsquo;t really reach the icon without a stretch and secondly, because I have to stretch I find that I don&rsquo;t have much mobility in my thumb as a consequence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/unlockscreen2.jpg" title="Title" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><strong>Me desperately trying to &lsquo;push&rsquo; the unlock screen up so I can get to the camera</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that the design is a bit different when the new (larger/wider) iPhone 6 comes out. Maybe the icon could be moved to the center somewhere or we there could be a little indicator arrow pointing up positioned bottom middle. This could reveal one or two functions on a single tap &ndash; one of which is the camera. It would be much easier to select it &ndash; with either hand!</p>

<p>Hopefully all those right handed people with small hands will have something to celebrate come September 9. It&rsquo;s not a massive thing &ndash; but I believe it would be a UX improvement.</p>
