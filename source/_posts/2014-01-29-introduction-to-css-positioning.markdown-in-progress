###Introduction
_The truth about CSS Positioning is that it's a pain in the ****. No matter how many times I read up on the topic, it still eludes me from time to time. I think it's because pages can get pretty complex and each one is different. Well, this article is an attempt to tackle the issue head on with as little fluff as possible. We won't be covering all of the details but we will be providing some basic definitions and examples. Hopefully this can provide beginners with a helpful reference from which the topic can be investigated and hopefully mastered.
