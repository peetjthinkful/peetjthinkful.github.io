###Rethinking the design of the 'unlock' screen
If you possess an iPhone, then you will be somewhat familiar with the 'unlock' screen. It would look something like this:

__My iPhone unlock screen__


The problem I have is that I have quite small hands and being right handed I generally carry my phone in my left hand and use it with my right. 'So what?' you might say! Well when I want to take a picture quickly I try to use my left hand to activate the camera from the camera icon. I usually find the swipe action next to impossible. Firstly my thumb doesn't really reach the icon without a stretch and secondly, because I have to stretch I find that I don't have much mobility in my thumb as a consequence.

I'm hoping that the design is a bit different when the new (larger/wider) iPhone 6 comes out. Maybe the icon could be moved to the center somewhere or we there could be a little indicator arrow pointing up positioned bottom middle. This could reveal one or two functions on a single tap - one of which is the camera. It would be much easier to select it - with either hand!

Hopefully all those right handed people with small hands will have something to celebrate come September 9. It's not a massive thing - but I believe it would be a UX improvement.
